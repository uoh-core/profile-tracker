                <h2>about this site</h2>
                <p>I use this site primarily for making communication easier but also for some blogposting. I came to the conclusion of making this website primarily due to discord's policies and state of using AI and other algorithmic procedures to assist its moderation. Certain patterns & speech can suspend your account even if no ill intention is present, and I have yet to elaborate on that matter through blogposting which will come soon.</p>
                <p>The main functionality behind this site is that I feed tokens locally and validate them via a discord endpoint, and then automate git push requests to update the static page with the response data which contains my account status.</p>
                <p>Through the server widget below, you can join my discord server whose purpose is to stay in touch with friends but also banter & discuss topics such as otaku/bishoujo/moe culture, music related topics & some tech related stuff as well.</p>

                <h3>regarding @44.uoh</h3>
                <div class="post-meta">20/01/2026</div>
                <p>My account @44.uoh got a child safety strike because I posted a tenor GIF in a banter server through the GIF search tab, and I selected a GIF that breaks the guidelines of tenor and discord. I explicitly mentioned that this GIF breaks ToS, however, it did not depict any sexual imagery but rather text and symbolism.</p>
                <p>This was taken out of context and I received a child safety warning which impacts my account, and appealing this warning won't make a difference as the appeal procedure is not human assisted in any way, and I will not be opening a support ticket on their website as you will receive automated responses for anything appeal related, be it regarding child safety or not.</p>
                <p>Since the account standing system is designed in a way where catching another child safety warning would get you suspended, I have decided not to take the risk and chose to make a new account which is now the 45th iteration.</p>
                <p><strong>Moral of the story:</strong> The system cannot tell context, and do not attempt to call out certain behaviour as that will likely land you a child safety strike especially if assisted through visuals like the GIF in my case.</p>

                <div class="post-meta">20/01/2026</div>
                <p>Iteration @45.uoh & @46.uoh has been suspended as I figured I can no longer register accounts under Mullvad VPN because every time I do so, I get phonelocked after joining a certain server through its vanity URL.</p>
                <p>I also figured that putting an URL in my bio will flag my account as "spam" and force me to re-verify my email for some reason, so I'll have to use the pronouns field and eventually shorten the URL to get around the character limit.</p>
