                <p>I use this site primarily for making communication easier but also for some blogposting. I came to the conclusion of making this website primarily due to discord's policies and state of using AI and other algorithmic procedures to assist its moderation. Certain patterns & speech can suspend your account even if no ill intention is present, and I have yet to elaborate on that matter through blogposting which will come soon.</p>
                
                <p>The main functionality behind this site is that I feed tokens locally and validate them via a discord endpoint, and then automate git push requests to update the static page with the response data which contains my account status.</p>
                
                <p>Through the server widget below, you can join my discord server whose purpose is to stay in touch with friends but also banter & discuss topics such as otaku/bishoujo/moe culture, music related topics & some tech related stuff as well.</p>

                <p>banned for 'spam' after sending out a single friend request. the system has a score system that bans you for spam once the threshold is reached. you can also be banned for spam out of nowhere since the threshold can be reached in the background through other means as well. you can guess which account I now use to casually proceed with my activities. in fact, I will likely start tracking server invites on this site as well if this bullshit happens to me ever again.</p>

                <h3>regarding otaku larpfags</h3>
                <div class="post-meta">22/01/2026</div>
                <p>So there was this disboard server tagged as 'visual novel' with 'Little Busters!' visual novel as the server icon. I joined, and I posted SFW pictures of moe anime characters with no sexually suggestive traits anywhere on the image, just the moe itself. They got deleted and I was told not to post any lewd stuff which I did not comment.</p>
                <p>I hopped into a voice chat with some - I'm guessing 14 year old - girl who has a shinobu oshino profile picture, and her friends were also in the VC.</p>
                <p>The conversation spiraled into a debate where I explicitly cited otaku culture history including that of visual novels, eroges and other light novels such as the Monogatari Series, and I explained the moe concept and the imperfection that the real world carries - this was in response to them accusing me of being a pedophile and claiming that all pedophiles consume lolicon material before acting upon their urges.</p>
                <p>I mocked the girl for having a profile picture dedicated to a series that would be summarized as 'child romance' to which I got banned from the server. Since I have no shame, I will list the disboard server down below: https://disboard.org/server/1406383285428551742</p>
                <p class="gap">It's honestly upsetting that algorithms and the bishoujo mainstream pushing the anime industry further into international waters as well as moral panic is influencing those uneducated susceptible individuals in such a way to engage in mental gymnastics, especially the younger generations who happen to rebrand anything otaku-centric as 'cutecore' in an attempt to reshape history under their own deluded ideals. cognitive dissonance is at play.</p>

                <div class="post-meta">21/01/2026</div>
                <p>My account got two child safety strikes but as we know, both are identical because discord can push duplicate strikes at once or consequently.</p>
                <p>In this case, I managed to successfully appeal both strikes by appealing the decision under "something else" which is the only field that allows me to input context, so I did and both strikes got turned down.</p>
                <p>To be more specific for this particular case, someone decided to take one of my messages "best part is 9+" out of context to make it sound like I was using sexual language to endorse sexualizing minors.</p>
                <p>This is not true though as the message was in reference to a an app on the appstore named "gooning tracker" with an age rating of 9+, and I sarcastically pointed at that age rating which ultimately got misinterpreted by AI thanks to social engineering the system.</p>

                <p>Iteration @45.uoh & @46.uoh has been suspended as I figured I can no longer register accounts under Mullvad VPN because every time I do so, I get phonelocked after joining a certain server through its vanity URL.</p>
                <p>I also figured that putting an URL in my bio will flag my account as "spam" and force me to re-verify my email for some reason, so I'll have to use the pronouns field and eventually shorten the URL to get around the character limit.</p>

                <h3>regarding @44.uoh</h3>
                <div class="post-meta">20/01/2026</div>
                <p>My account @44.uoh got a child safety strike because I posted a tenor GIF in a banter server through the GIF search tab, and I selected a GIF that breaks the guidelines of tenor and discord. I explicitly mentioned that this GIF breaks ToS, however, it did not depict any sexual imagery but rather text and symbolism.</p>
                <p>This was taken out of context and I received a child safety warning which impacts my account, and appealing this warning won't make a difference as the appeal procedure is not human assisted in any way, and I will not be opening a support ticket on their website as you will receive automated responses for anything appeal related, be it regarding child safety or not.</p>
                <p>Since the account standing system is designed in a way where catching another child safety warning would get you suspended, I have decided not to take the risk and chose to make a new account which is now the 45th iteration.</p>
                <p><strong>Moral of the story:</strong> The system cannot tell context, and do not attempt to call out certain behaviour as that will likely land you a child safety strike especially if assisted through visuals like the GIF in my case.</p>
